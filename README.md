# 52954_MACHINE_LEARNING_AND_STATISTICS

52954 Machine Learning and Statistics Project

This project is about the "well-known Boston House Prices dataset".

https://www.kaggle.com/altavish/boston-housing-dataset#HousingData.csv

I will use the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter.

Firstly I will Describe the data, using descriptive statistics and plots.

Secondly I will use inferential statistics to analyse house prices of houses which are along the river Charles and houses that are not.

Thirdly I will use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.
